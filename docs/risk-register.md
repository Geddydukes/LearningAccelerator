## Detailed Risk Analysis

### R001: Agent Rate Limiting
**Description**: Gemini API rate limits could block user interactions during peak usage.

**Impact**: 
- User experience degradation
- Learning session interruptions
- Potential user churn

**Mitigation**:
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter
- Queue system for non-urgent requests
- Multiple API key rotation
- Real-time rate limit monitoring
- Graceful error messages to users

**Monitoring**:
- API response time dashboards
- Rate limit hit frequency
- Queue depth metrics

### R002: ElevenLabs Quota Exceeded
**Description**: Voice synthesis quota limits could disable audio features.

**Impact**:
- Loss of voice interaction capability
- Reduced learning engagement
- Feature degradation

**Mitigation**:
- Aggressive audio caching strategy
- Usage monitoring and alerts
- Fallback to text-only mode
- User voice preference settings
- Monthly quota planning

**Monitoring**:
- Daily voice generation usage
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- User voice feature adoption

### R003: Database Outage
**Description**: Supabase database unavailability could halt all user operations.

**Impact**:
- Complete service unavailability
- Data loss risk
- User trust damage

**Mitigation**:
- Multi-region Supabase configuration
- Automated daily backups
- Read replica setup
- Local storage fallback for critical data
- Incident response procedures

**Monitoring**:
- Database uptime monitoring
- Backup verification
- Connection pool health

### R004: Cost Overrun
**Description**: Unexpected usage spikes could exceed budget projections.

**Impact**:
- Financial sustainability risk
- Service shutdown necessity
- Investor confidence loss

**Mitigation**:
- Real-time cost monitoring dashboards
- Per-user usage caps
- Tiered pricing implementation
- Monthly budget reviews
- Cost optimization strategies

**Monitoring**:
- Daily cost tracking
- Per-feature cost attribution
- User usage patterns

### R005: Token Overflow
**Description**: Long conversations could exceed Gemini context limits.

**Impact**:
- Conversation context loss
- Degraded agent responses
- User experience issues

**Mitigation**:
- Conversation summarization algorithms
- Sliding window context management
- Prompt optimization for efficiency
- Context compression techniques
- User session management

**Monitoring**:
- Average token usage per session
- Context window utilization
- Conversation length distribution
