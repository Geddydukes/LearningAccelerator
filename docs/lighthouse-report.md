   - Consider script bundling

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. **Advanced Caching**
   - Implement Redis caching
   - Add CDN for global distribution
   - Optimize API response times

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add real user monitoring
   - Set up performance alerts
   - Implement performance budgets

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. **Advanced Optimizations**
   - Consider server-side rendering (SSR)
   - Implement progressive web app (PWA) features
   - Add advanced image optimization

## Testing Strategy
